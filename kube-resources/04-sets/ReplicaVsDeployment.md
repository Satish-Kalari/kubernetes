# ReplicaSet Vs Deployment sets in Kubernetes
ReplicaSet is the older version of Deployment.

ReplicaSet is a more basic concept and it is used to guarantee a specified number of pod replicas are running at any given time.

Deployment is a higher-level concept that manages ReplicaSets and provides declarative updates to Pods and ReplicaSets.

It is a more complex concept and it is used to provide new updates to the pods.
